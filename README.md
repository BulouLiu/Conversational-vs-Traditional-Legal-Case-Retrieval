# Conversational-vs-Traditional-Legal-Case-Retrieval

## Introduction
This is a conversational legal case retrieval dataset collected in a lab-based user study. 

This dataset contains 127 tasks from legal practitioners’ real information needs. 

Specifically, there are 55 tasks conducted by both traditional and conversational paradigms (reported in our paper) and 72 tasks just by the conversational paradigm (`extend version.zip`).

This dataset was created in a wizard-of-oz approach. We recruited legal experts as intermediary agents following three principles
 - They had passed the “National Uniform Legal Profession Qualification Examination”
 - They only participated in the task according their research fields.
 - They all achieved at least a score of 95 in courses related to their experimental topics.
